# Feature List

This will be an overview of the features I am looking to create.

## Random Sound Generator

Based on sound profiles of specific sounds, I want to generate random variances.

## Frequency Training

Using frequencies, users have to guess the frequency and a score will be given, based on the distance.

## Sound Visualizer

Based on the audio playing, I want a show of sorts, which will move to the audio.

## Dynamic Audio Player

Based on the art or setting the user sets, a audio player will dynamically generate and will be somewhat unique.
